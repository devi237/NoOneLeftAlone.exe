Intelligent Real-Time Crowd Monitoring \& Alert System



NoOneLeftAlone.exe is an AI-powered real-time monitoring system designed to enhance safety and situational awareness in public and semi-public environments.



The system leverages Computer Vision and Machine Learning to detect human presence from live video feeds, monitor crowd density, and automatically generate alerts when predefined safety thresholds are exceeded.



It integrates hardware (camera devices) with a software-based monitoring dashboard to provide a scalable and proactive crowd management solution.



**1. Problem Statement**



Overcrowding and lack of real-time monitoring in public spaces such as educational institutions, transportation hubs, events, and commercial areas can lead to safety risks.



Manual monitoring methods are:



* Inefficient



* Delayed



* Error-prone



* There is a need for an automated, intelligent system that can:



* Detect human presence in real time



* Evaluate crowd density



* Trigger alerts proactively



* Maintain historical data records



**2. Proposed Solution**



NoOneLeftAlone.exe provides an automated monitoring pipeline:



* Capture live video input



* Detect humans using AI-based object detection



* Count detected individuals



* Compare count against configured threshold



* Generate alert if threshold is exceeded



* Store event details in database



* Display monitoring data via web dashboard



* This enables early detection of overcrowding and improves response time.
